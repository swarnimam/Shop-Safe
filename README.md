# Shop-Safe
During the COVID-19, to implement social distancing at stores, we have built an app that allows users to select a grocery store
in their vicinity and pick a time slot during which they will be
visiting the store. If there are more than the permissible number of people at the store at a particular time slot, the app
cautions the user about the same.
